This repo contains code for authenticating with [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) and fetching secrets. The code can be run as a script at commandline, and it can also be used by Python applications as a package.

The script is run in a Kubernetes Init Container for [Artsy apps](https://github.com/artsy/hokusai-sandbox/blob/e04dc52c7e5cd0144c34ba0541e7d32fc84bc15f/hokusai/staging.yml#L35).
